                “Sir you've got to believe me if you go into that car you won’t return!” pleaded Elizabeth Red. “Red you’re ruining my first impression with Mr.Larson!” “You know how crucial this deal is for me, I m-mean for our company,” he said as he massaged his temples. “Please sir I have this hun-”. “Oh, you and your outrageous hunches!” he scolded. “What she means is that we would be delighted to accept your offer,” he said as he turned to face the man. The man who had taken everything from me. 
                
                
                
                Almost 12 years earlier  
                
                11-year-old Elizabeth looked up in horror as a fiery inferno swept up her beloved home. So many innocent memories tumbling out into the flames. Screams reverberated throughout the neighborhood. But only two remained clear and they came from the burning house. Her mother and father! They were still in the house. She ran forward into the ember flames but a rigid hand pulled her back and said coldly “It's too late little one there beyond saving now.” She turned and looked back to see a man he looked down in sympathy but his cold eyes glinted like coals on a sultry night steering away any emotions from his face.

                <h3>My poem</h3>
                <p>Waking up to an empty street 
                    Makes home feel incomplete  
                    The outside world feels quite obsolete
                    
                    Being stuck at home  is very boring 
                    Because I am never exploring 
                    The outside world is quite luring 
                    
                    I sit at my window still on the second floor 
                    Awaiting the outdoors   
                    The outside world is not yet quite yours
                    
                    
                    -Sahithi
                    </p>
